This is a port of the Apple sample program "Sketch" to MacRuby.  It is based on the version of Sketch shipped as part to the developer tools for Snow Leopard.  

The MacRuby version closely follows the Objective C version  with the following differences:

1. Ruby idioms have been used where this made sense.

2. Proxy objects have been used as observers.  The ObjC Sketch uses the objects directly and then uses the context parameter to select the appropriate response in a large switch statement.  Apart from being ugly the context parameters was set to the address of a static unique static string for the relevant classes and this doesn't translate nicely to Ruby.

3. The script support has been stripped out.

I am adding in no licensing, copying or use restrictions.  This is unsupported code and you use at your own risk.  Apple's licensing restrictions still apply.
